,>,>++++++[-<--------<-------->>] Store 2 numbers from keyboard in (0) and (1); and subtract 48 from each
<<[                               This is the main loop which continues until the dividend in (0) is zero
>[->+>+<<]                        Destructively copy the divisor from (1) to (2) and (3); setting (1) to zero
>[-<<-                            Subtract the divisor in (2) from the dividend in (0); the difference is stored in (0) and (2) is cleared
[>]>>>[<[>>>-<<<[-]]>>]<<]        If the dividend in (0) is zero; exit the loop
>>>+                              Add one to the quotient in (5)
<<[-<<+>>]                        Destructively copy the divisor in (3) to (1)
